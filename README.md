# Morse code convertor
An utility to convert regular text to morse code.

You're going to need to install [Haxe](https://haxe.org) to compile:

```bash
#debian
apt install haxe
#arch
pacman -S haxe
```

You will also need to install the hxcppp library: ``haxelib install hxcpp``

Compile using ``build.sh``

The resulting file will be in bin/Morse
